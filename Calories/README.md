<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This project develops a regression model to predict the number of calories burned based on various physical characteristics and exercise activities. The model utilizes XGBoost Regressor, a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm for regression problems.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<h3>Data collection and processing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data is loaded from two CSV files containing information about exercises and calories burned</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data analysis</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>The datasets are combined, and an exploratory data analysis is conducted, including statistical analysis and distribution visualization</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conversion of categorical variables</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Gender column is converted into numerical values to be used by the model</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data visualization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Graphs are used to visualize variable distributions and to analyze correlations between them</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data splitting</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The data is split into training and testing sets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model training</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The XGBoost Regressor model is trained on the training data</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model evaluation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The model is evaluated on the test dataset using mean absolute error to measure the average difference between predicted and actual values</li>
</ul>
