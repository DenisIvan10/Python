<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This project is a Python-based machine learning tool designed to predict the outcomes of football matches using historical data. The code utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to train a model on match data and then predict the results of future matches. It is useful for sports analysts and anyone looking to improve the accuracy of football match predictions.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<h3>Data processing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Loading match data from a CSV file</li>
  <li>Cleaning the data and generating new features, including encoding categorical variables, extracting features from dates and times, and generating new variables based on these</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model training</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>The data is split into training and testing sets based on the match dates</li>
  <li>A Random Forest model is trained to predict whether a team will win a match based on factors such as match location, opponent, time, and day of the week</li>
</ul>
<h3>Predictions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The model is used to predict the results of matches in the test set</li>
  <li>The accuracy of the predictions is calculated using the accuracy_score metric</li>
  <li>The precision score is also calculated to evaluate the model's performance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advanced analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rolling averages for various match features are generated to improve predictions</li>
  <li>Match results are predicted using these rolling averages, and the model's accuracy is re-evaluated</li>
  <li>Predictions are compared with the actual match outcomes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data mapping and combination</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Team names are mapped using a dictionary to standardize their names</li>
  <li>Predicted results for opposing teams are combined to analyze situations where a predicted winning team faces a predicted losing team</li>
</ul>
