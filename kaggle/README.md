# Spooky Books Author Identification - EDA & Baseline

Kaggle Playground Competition (2025): Predict the author of horror story excerpts  
**Authors:** Edgar Allan Poe (`EAP`), H.P. Lovecraft (`HPL`), Mary Shelley (`MWS`)

## üìì Project Overview

This repository contains an interactive exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook for the [Kaggle Spooky Books competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification), along with the first steps towards building a classification model.

**Goal:**  
Given excerpts of horror texts, predict which of the three classic authors wrote each passage.

## üöÄ Workflow Summary

### Data Exploration (EDA)

- **Wordclouds per author:**  
  Visualize the most common words for each author to identify stylistic patterns.
- **Text length analysis:**  
  Distribution of text lengths per author using boxplots.
- **Punctuation frequency:**  
  Compare the number of punctuation marks in excerpts per author.
- **Top words per author:**  
  Identify and plot the most frequent words (excluding stopwords) for each author.

### Feature Engineering

- Add features such as:
    - Text length
    - Punctuation count
    - Most frequent words

## üìù Submission Instructions
For Kaggle submission, output a CSV with the format:
```bash
id,EAP,HPL,MWS
id07943,0.33,0.33,0.33
```
Each row must include probabilities for all three authors.
